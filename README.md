# hello-world

First steps into the coding world.

I've been privileged to be able to work with companies in the capital markets (both public and private) and now I want to step out of my comfort zone and take on hard skills. Hence my foray into Github (: Looking to pick up coding ability and understanding of the cloud infrastructure.
